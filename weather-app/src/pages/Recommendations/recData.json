        "During rainy weather, ensure proper drainage in your fields to prevent waterlogging and root rot.",
        "Consider planting crops that are resistant to waterlogging and can thrive in wet conditions, such as rice or certain varieties of wheat.",
        "Implement strategies to minimize soil erosion, such as contour plowing or planting cover crops."
      ],
      "clouds": [
        "In cloudy weather, monitor humidity levels to prevent fungal diseases in crops.",
        "Focus on crops that tolerate lower light conditions, such as leafy greens or root vegetables.",
        "Utilize row covers or greenhouses to provide additional protection for sensitive crops against temperature fluctuations associated with cloud cover."
      ],
      "snow": [
        "Before the snow season, ensure proper insulation and protection for perennial crops to prevent frost damage.",
        "Consider using cold frames or high tunnels to extend the growing season and protect crops from snow accumulation.",
        "Plan for snow removal strategies to maintain access to fields and protect infrastructure such as greenhouses or storage facilities."
      ],
      "default": [
        "During clear or sunny weather, focus on optimizing irrigation schedules to ensure adequate moisture for crops.",
        "Implement mulching techniques to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature during periods of high heat.",
        "Monitor pest populations closely, as warm and sunny weather can lead to increased insect activity."
